Antibrute
========================
This app helps to prevent brute force attack on the login view. The app keeps 
track of failed attempts with ip addresses. If a certain number of failed attempts 
are recorded on a particular user name then the user name is locked for few 
seconds. 

Refer to the docs for details on how to configure different functions of the app.

With the recorded failure data, it is possible to detect if the attack is 
distributed. At present there are no direct feature utilizing this but can be 
added in the future.
